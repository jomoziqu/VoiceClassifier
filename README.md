# VoiceClassifier
This project is a machine learning model that classifies the gender of voices as either human male, human female, robot male, or robot female. The model is trained using deep neural networks on extracted audio features such as MFCCs, pitch, and formants.

## System Requirements

Python
TensorFlow
Librosa
Numpy
sklearn

## Installation
-Clone this repository
-Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
-Run the VoiceClassifier.ipynb file to train the model and make predictions on audio files.
-You can change the audio files in the provided lists to test with your own samples.
-The model will output the predicted gender label for the provided audio samples.

## Model Architecture
-Input: MFCCs, pitch, formants
-Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
-Output: Human male, Human female, Robot male, Robot female
